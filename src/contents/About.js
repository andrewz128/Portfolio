        <p>
          I am a seasoned professional with eight years of IT experience and 5+
          years of Full Stack JS developer experience. My main focus is on JS
          libraries like React, Vue, React Native, Angular, and Node. And I am
          familiar with Laravel and Swift as well. I will create any web or
          mobile project you require with the mentioned skills above. My biggest
          strength is the experience I gained while working on many projects for
          a long time. If you hire me, high-quality cords and long-term support
          will reward your expectations. As a solo developer, I am flexible on
          working hours. I will always be by your side until the project is
          completed and would like to establish a friendly relationship with
          you. Thank you.
